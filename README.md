# 🎬 Flixora – The Popcorn-Powered Movie Ticket Booking Website 🍿

> _Built with sweat, caffeine, memes, and the mighty MERN stack._

Welcome to **Flixora** – a full-stack movie ticket booking experience so smooth, even Thanos would snap his fingers twice to book tickets.

---

## 🧩 What's This Project?

In this tutorial, we’ll build and deploy a **Full Stack Movie Ticket Booking Website** using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), plus some ✨ fancy extras like **Clerk** and **Inngest**.

---

## 🎟️ What Can Users Do?

- ✍️ Sign up (with email, social, or even that old Nokia number).
- 🎬 Explore movies like they’re Netflix-ing.
- 💺 Choose seats (yes, even that lonely one in the corner).
- ✅ Book tickets and get *super* cool confirmation emails.
- 🔁 Switch between multiple profiles — for your main self, alter ego, and secret movie critic identity.

---

## 🧑‍💼 What Can Admins Do?

- 🛠️ Log in to the **Admin Dashboard**.
- 🎥 Add spicy new movies to the platform.
- 📋 Manage bookings like a boss.

---

## 🔐 Authentication? More like AuthentiFUN! 😎

We’ve used **Clerk** to handle all the identity drama. You get:

- ✅ Email Signups  
- 🔗 Social Signups  
- 📱 Phone Number Signups  
- 👥 **Multi-sessions** – because why just be one person when you can be many?

## 🛠️ Background Magic with Inngest ✉️

We've sprinkled some **Inngest** fairy dust to manage:

- 🎉 Email alerts when new movies are added.
- 📩 Booking confirmations.
- ⏰ Reminder emails a few hours before your movie starts (so you don't miss that opening scene).

## ⏳ Timeout Drama 🎭 – The 10-Minute Rule

If your payment fails (because the internet betrayed you):
- Your seats stay reserved for **10 minutes**.
- Enough time to restart your payment, your Wi-Fi, and your will to live.
- If you don’t make it in time, your seats will be gracefully released for the next movie warrior.

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- 🟢 **MongoDB** – plot-twist-filled NoSQL database
- ⚙️ **Express.js** – backend that never says “Interval!”
- 🎨 **React.js** – a front-end smoother than a Bollywood dance sequence
- 🌐 **Node.js** – because JavaScript is everywhere
- 🔐 **Clerk** – authentication, but make it fashion
- ⏱️ **Inngest** – background tasks with a touch of elegance

---

## 🚀 How to Run This Beast?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/narendraxgupta/flixora.git
cd flixora
npm install
```

Setup your `.env` file like your secret popcorn recipe. Then:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Sit back, grab popcorn, and enjoy your locally hosted movieverse.

## 🐞 Bugs?

PRs welcome. Memes appreciated. Snacks optional but encouraged.

---

## 🎉 Final Words

> Movies change lives. Booking them shouldn’t be hard.

Go build it. Deploy it. Share it. And maybe... book a ticket for yourself while you're at it.
